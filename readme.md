# Awesome List of COVID19 Response Resources [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Great resources for responding to COVID19 during the pandemic. 

## Description

This list isn't a list of COVID19 information. No trackers, maps or news about the virus. Let's just put together a good list of resources for making the response to the pandemic better for everyone.  This may include ways to get involved, entertainment, deals from companies for consumers and businesses or resources for working from home. 

I'm open to new categories so just read the [contributing doc](contributing.md) and provide a pull request.
